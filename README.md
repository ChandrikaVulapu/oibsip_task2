🎯 Guess the Number - Java Game Project 🎯
As part of my Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship, I built this fun little game where your only mission is to guess the number! 😄

The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. Sounds simple? Well… it’s surprisingly addictive! 🧠✨ With each guess, the game gives hints — “too high” or “too low” — keeping you on your toes.

I also added cool features like:

Limited number of attempts 🎯

Multiple rounds for extra fun 🔁

A scoring system based on how quickly you guess 🏆

It’s a short but engaging project that really helped me sharpen my Java basics in a playful way. Give it a try — it’s more thrilling than it sounds! 😄
